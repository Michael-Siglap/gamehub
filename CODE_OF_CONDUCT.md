# Code of Conduct

## 💫 Our Pledge

In the spirit of making GameTap a fun and welcoming space for everyone, we pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for all, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We're building this together in our spare time because we love gaming and web development - let's make sure everyone feels that same joy when they're part of our community!

## 🌈 Our Standards

Examples of behavior that helps create a positive environment:

- Being kind and empathetic toward others
- Respecting different opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility for our mistakes and learning from them
- Focusing on what's best for the community and the project

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Using sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention
- Trolling, insulting comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## 🤝 Our Responsibilities

As the project maintainer, I am responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that appears inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Remember that this is a spare-time project, so responses might not be immediate, but rest assured that all reports will be taken seriously.

## 🌍 Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## ✉️ Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
