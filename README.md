## 💡 What's This All About?

GameTap started as a passion project that I work on whenever I can find some free time. The idea is to create a community-driven platform where game enthusiasts can discover new games and eventually contribute their own. I'd love for you to join me on this journey!

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive game discovery interface (browse through the collection with style!)
- Category filtering and search functionality (find exactly what you're looking for)
- Responsive design for all devices (game on the go!)
- Beautiful animations and transitions (because we like pretty things)
- Game detail modal with descriptions (know what you're getting into)
